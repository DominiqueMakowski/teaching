## Recap {.center background-color="#1A237E"}

- We learned about the **Bayes' Theorem**: 
  - $P(H|X) =\frac{P(H)~P(X|H)}{P(X)}$
- And how it can be used to update our beliefs about a hypothesis given new data

## Final nail in the coffin for the *p*-value

:::: {.column width="50%"}

<!-- ![](img/LuciferLikesP.jpg){width="30%"} -->

- Another thing often heard about the *p*-value is that it can only be used to **reject** the **null hypothesis** (effect = 0), not as an index of evidence **in favour of the null**
- This is because the *p*-value, by definition, is **uniformly distributed** under the null hypothesis
  - This means that, if the null hypothesis is true, all values of the *p*-value are equally likely; *p* = .001 is just as likely as *p* = 1

- Altough Frequentists recently came up with some workarounds (region of practical equivalence testing), it is still seen as a limitation of the Frequentist framework
- This is problematic in science because we are often interested in disproving a hypothesis, or proving that there is no effect

## Bayes Factor (BF)

- **Bayes' Theorem**: $P(H|data) =\frac{P(H)~P(data|H)}{P(data)}$
  - Bayes' theorem relates the probability of a hypothesis (H) given some observed evidence (data X) to the probability of data given the hypothesis, as well as the prior probability of the hypothesis
  - $P(data|H)$ is the likelihood of the data given a hypothesis
  - It corresponds to a "model of the world"
  - In the previous example, we had "the model" of coin tosses. We know the likelihood of outcomes given various coin types because it corresponds to a physical reality (a fair coin gives 50% heads). So the "model" was obvious and easy to define
  - But often, the model's likelihood depends on uncertain parameter over which we have other priors (e.g., instead of being fixed to 0.7/0.3, I define the outcome of the coin toss as unknown range)
  - In real-life scenarios, the **likelihood is complex to compute/approximate**, but it is not impossible. And accessing the likelihood is very useful... 
  
## Bayes Factor (BF) 

- Bayes' theorem provides a natural way to test hypotheses. Suppose we have two competing hypotheses: **H1** and an alternative hypothesis **H0**
- What if we compared the likelihood of the data given two competing hypotheses?
- $P(data|H_{0})$ / $P(data|H_{1})$
- This ratio of likelihoods is known as the **Bayes Factor** (BF)
  - It quantifies the relative strength of evidence in favor of **one hypothesis over another** based on the observed evidence (data)
  - It tells us how much more likely the data (evidence) is under one hypothesis compared to another (often taking into account prior probabilities in the definition of the likelihood model)
- $BF_{10} = \frac{P(data|H_{1})}{P(data|H_{0})}$
- $BF_{01} = \frac{P(data|H_{0})}{P(data|H_{1})}$
  - Note the convention of writing what is the numerator

<!-- - From Bayes' theorem, it follows that:  -->
<!-- - $\underbrace{\frac{P(H_1 | D)}{P(H_0 | D)}}_{posterior~odds} = \underbrace{\frac{P(D | H_1)}{P(D | H_0)}}_{Bayes~Factor} \cdot \underbrace{\frac{P(H_1)}{P(H_0)}}_{prior~odds}$ -->

## BFs with BIC approximation

- The Bayes Factor is a ratio of likelihoods, which is often difficult to compute, especially for Bayesian models where parameters are themselves probabilistic
- Wagenmakers (2007)^[Wagenmakers, E. J. (2007). A practical solution to the pervasive problems of p values. Psychonomic bulletin & review, 14(5), 779-804.] <sub><sup>*(one of the principal proponent of Bayes factors)*</sup></sub> proposed an approximation of the Bayes Factor based on the **Bayesian Information Criterion** (BIC), that can easily be computed for traditional Frequentist models (e.g., linear models)
- $BF_{01} \approx exp(\frac{BIC_{1} - BIC_{0}}{2})$

## Model 0: qsec ~ mpg

- `mpg` is a significant predictor of `qsec` ($\beta$ = 0.12, *p* < .05)

## Model 1: qsec ~ mpg + wt

:::::

- Be careful! A model with multiple predictors is different from individual models taking separately (because variable interact with each other)
- Is **model1** better than **model0**?
- Higher R2, but more parameters (more complex model). Comparing BICs is an alterantive that takes into account the number of parameters

## Extract BICs

perf0 <- performance::performance(model0)
perf0

bic0

```{r}
#| echo: true

bic1 <- performance::performance(model1)$BIC
bic1
```

::::

- Normally, the lower the BIC, the better the model
- Hard to interpret in absolute terms (the unit is meaningless), but we can compare models (if they are related to the same data)

## Compare BICs

- $BF_{10} \approx exp(\frac{BIC_{0} - BIC_{1}}{2})$
- We can apply the formula to `bic1` and `bic0`

bf10 <- exp((bic0 - bic1) / 2)
bf10
```

::::

- You computed an approximation of the Bayes Factor "by hand"!

## Using `bayestestR`

```{r}
#| echo: true

bayestestR::bayesfactor_models(model1, denominator=model0)
```


## BF10 vs. BF01

- Bayes factors are a **ratio** of likelihood of data under some hypothesis
- They quantify "how much" the data is more likely under one model compared to another
- $BF_{10} = 3.80$ means the data is 3.80 times more likely under **model1** than **model0**
- **Importantly**, BFs are "reversable":
- $BF_{01} = \frac{1}{BF_{10}} = 1 / 3.80 = 0.263$
- The data is 0.26 times more likely under **model0** than **model1**
- We gather evidence **both ways** (in *favour* or *against* a hypothesis)

## Exercice {background-color="#FFAB91"}

- Compute the Bayes Factor for the following models: `qsec ~ wt` vs. a **constant model**
- A constant model, aka an "intercept-only" model, is a model with no predictors (only an intercept)
- A constant model basically predicts the mean of the outcome variable for all observations

## *t*-Tests

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

- True Bayes factor (i.e., not approximations using Frequentist models) can be also computed for "simple" tests, such as *t*-tests
- *t*-tests test for the difference of means of a variable between two groups (or against a constant value)
- This is a frequentist *t*-test:

::::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

# `am` is a binary variable (0 and 1)
t.test(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$am)
```

:::::
::::
:::: {.column width="50%"}

::::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

mtcars |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=as.factor(am), y=mpg)) +
  geom_jitter(width=0.1, size=3)  
```

:::::

- We conclude that there is a significance difference between the two groups (am == 1 > am == 0, *p* < .01)
::::
:::

## Bayesian *t*-Tests

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

- They are implemented in the `BayesFactor` package (by Richard Morey) where BFs are computed using a technique called *Gaussian Quadrature* ^[Rouder, J. N., Speckman, P. L., Sun, D., Morey, R. D., & Iverson, G. (2009). Bayesian *t*-tests for accepting and rejecting the null hypothesis. Psychonomic bulletin & review, 16, 225-237.] possible for simple models <sub><sup>(not important)<sub></sup>
- The Bayes factor compares two hypotheses: that the standardized effect size is 0, or that the standardized effect size is not 0.

::::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

library(BayesFactor)  # Case sensitive!

# Note the use of `formula` and `data` arguments
BayesFactor::ttestBF(formula=mpg ~ am, data=mtcars)
```

:::::

::::

:::: {.column}

- What can we conclude?
- $BF_{10}$ = 86.59
- Very strong evidence in favour of the hypothesis that there is a non-null difference between the two groups
- What about priors?
  - In this particular case, let's just say that they are good enough "default" priors (there is a lot of literature justifying it). Can be used "as-is" without worry\*
  - \*Some people will strongly disagree with this

::::

:::


## Correlation Test

- The `BayesFactor` package also implements correlation tests

::: {.fragment}
```{r}
#| echo: true

library(BayesFactor)  # Case sensitive!

BayesFactor::correlationBF(mtcars$drat, mtcars$qsec)
```
:::

- What can we conclude?
- $BF_{10}$ = 0.43
- No evidence in favour of any models (that there is a null vs. non-null correlation)

## Priors

- Remember: the Bayes Factor is a ratio of the likelihood of the data under the two models
- $\underbrace{\frac{P(H_1 | D)}{P(H_0 | D)}}_{posterior~odds} = \underbrace{\frac{P(D | H_1)}{P(D | H_0)}}_{Bayes~Factor} \cdot \underbrace{\frac{P(H_1)}{P(H_0)}}_{prior~odds}$
- The likelhood can be interpreted as an **updating factor**: how much the data updated our prior beliefs
  - In other words, how much did we move from Prior to Posterior
- The stronger the BF, the stronger the "difference" between the **prior** and the **posterior**
- But what is the prior?
  - Remember, we are trying to estimate the correlation coefficient rho $\rho$ after seeing the data
  - But we need to have a prior idea of what $\rho$ could be
- How to specify a prior for $\rho$?

## Prior Distribution

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

- In the previous examples, we had priors in the form of discrete categories (e.g., 1/3 that the coin is fair, 1/3 that it's rigged, ...)

::::: {.fragment}

```{r}
d <- data.frame(
  cointypes=c(0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7),
  prior=c(1, 2, 3, 2, 1) / 9
)

d |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=cointypes, y=prior)) +
  geom_line(color="blue") + 
  geom_point(size=3, color="blue") +  
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7), 
                     labels = paste0(c(0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7), "\n", c("Biased", "Imperfect", "Fair", "Imperfect", "Biased"))) +
  labs(x="Coin type", y="Prior Probability", title="Prior for the Gentleman") +
  theme_bw()
```

:::::

- But how to specify a prior for a continuous variable like a correlation coefficient?
- Using a distribution!

::::
:::: {.column}

- Let's imagine taking a normal distribution as a prior for $\rho$ (i.e., we think that $\rho$ is normally distributed)
- Imagine that someone proposes the following parameters
  - e.g., $\mu = 0.42, \sigma = 0.7$

::::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

xspace <- seq(-1.5, 1.5, by=0.01)
prob <- dnorm(xspace, mean=0.42, sd=0.333)

data <- data.frame(x = xspace, y = prob) 

data |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=x, y=y)) +
  geom_line(color="blue", linewidth=3) 
```

:::::
::::
:::

## Exercice {background-color="#FFAB91"}

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

- Do you think this is a good prior?
- Why is this not a very good prior?
- Try to come up with a suitable prior for the correlation coefficient $\rho$ 

::::

:::: {.column}

```{r}
#| echo: false

data |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=x, y=y)) +

```

::::

:::


## Solution {background-color="#80DEEA"}

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 80%;"}

- Priors represent your beliefs **before** seeing the data
  - In can be from previous studies, from your own experience, from your intuition, ...
- Do we have a hypothesis about the direction (positive vs. negative) of the correlation between `drat` and `qsec`
  - No. The correlation could be positive or negative.
- Do we have reasons to expect a non-null correlation?
  - No. 
  - Our prior could be symmetric around 0, with a higher probability on 0 (i.e., we think that the correlation is more likely to be 0 than any other value)
  
::::
:::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 80%;"}
  
- What about $Normal(0, 0.5)$

::::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

data$y <- dnorm(xspace, mean=0, sd=0.5) 

data |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=x, y=y)) +
  geom_line(color="blue", linewidth=3) 
```

:::::

- What's the problem?

::::
:::

## Priors for Correlation Coefficients?

- Bayesian inference is, fundamentally, the process of reallocating *credibility* across candidate parameter values
  - From prior to posterior
- Priors **should** incorporate "domain knowledge" (critical for good Bayesian models)
  - For example, knowledge about the range of possible values
- We know that the correlation coefficient is bounded between -1 and 1 by definition. We should incorporate this knowledge in our prior and assign a probability of 0 to values outside of this range
- How can we do that?
  - We could use a truncated normal distribution (e.g., $Normal(0, 0.5)$ truncated between -1 and 1)
  - Or pick a distribution that has bounds
- What is a distribution that has negative and positive bounds?

## What about *Uniform*?

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="50%" }

- $Uniform(-1, 1)$ means that all values between -1 and 1 are equally likely

::::: {.fragment}
```{r}
#| echo: true

# Compute the uniform distribution
data$y <- dunif(xspace, -1, 1) 

data |> 
  ggplot(aes(y=y)) +
  geom_line(aes(x=x), color="blue", linewidth=3) +
  theme_bw()
```
:::::

::::
:::: {.column width="50%" }

- This is a **non-informative prior**
  - i.e., we don't introduce any prior knowledge about the correlation coefficient (other than domain knowledge about what a correlation coefficient is)
  - As we will see later, uniform priors tend to give results that are similar to frequentist maximum likelihood estimates (i.e., Bayesian models with uniform priors tend to have very similar results to frequentist models)
- But they are non-recommended.
  - They are often non realistic: we tend to have some expectations about our parameters, and priors should reflect these beliefs

::::
:::

## What other prior?

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

- What is another distribution that has bounds?
  - The beta distribution!
- But what's the problem?
  - It is defined on the interval [0, 1]
- Solution?
  - Distributions can often be *scaled* and *shifted*
  
::::
:::: {.column width="50%"}

![](img/distributions.jpg)
::::
:::

## Shifted and Scaled Beta

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="50%"}

- We can have a shifted & scaled beta distribution that is defined on the interval [-1, 1] with a peak at 0 
- E.g., How about $Beta(1.5, 1.5)$ rescaled and shifted to [-1, 1]?


::::
:::: {.column width="50%"}

::::: {.fragment}
```{r}
#| echo: true

# Compute the beta distribution
data$y <- dbeta(xspace, 1.5, 1.5)
# Rescale its x-axis
data$x2 <- (data$x - 0.5) * 2

data |>
  ggplot(aes(y=y)) +
  geom_line(aes(x=x), color="blue", linewidth=3) +
  geom_line(aes(x=x2), color="orange", linewidth=2, alpha=0.9) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(-1.2, 1.2)) +
  theme_bw()
```

:::::

- Original distribution in blue and shifted and scaled in orange   

::::
:::

## Meaning

```{r}
#| echo: false

data |>
  ggplot(aes(y=y)) +
  geom_line(aes(x=x2), color="orange", linewidth=2, alpha=0.9) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(-1.2, 1.2)) +
  theme_bw()
```

- This means that we think that the correlation coefficient is more likely to be 0, and then "gradually" less likely as we move away from 0, with very low likelihood for values close to -1 or 1


## BayesFactor's defaults

- The Bayes Factor is sensitive to the choice of prior
- In this case, the wider the prior, the lower the Bayes factor
  - Why?
- It's not **always** the case

## Misconceptions about Bayes Factors

- BFs do **not** tell us the absolute probability of a hypothesis being true. It quantifies how much we should **update** our belief in a hypothesis. If this hypothesis was extremely unlikely, then we might still believe it to be very unlikely, even after computing a large BF.
- BFs provide **relative** evidence between 2 hypotheses, and it is possible that one hypothesis is supported more than another hypothesis, while both hypotheses are false. Saying *"BF shows evidence for the null (H0)"* is incorrect. It should be *"BF shows evidence for the H0 as compared to H1"* (what H1 is matters).
- BFs tell us nothing about the size of effects.
- See [Lakens' post](https://lakens.github.io/statistical_inferences/04-bayes.html#sec-bfgmisconceptions) for details


## Bayes Factors: Summary

::: {style="font-size: 90%"}

- Bayes factor are **intuitive** indices measuring of the strength of evidence for one hypothesis over another
  - They have a natural interpretation in terms of odds (e.g., 3:1 odds), and have wide applications (comparing models, null-hypothesis testing, ...)
  - They have well established interpretation guidelines (> 3; > 10; > 30; > 100)
- They are "easy" to compute for simple statistical tests, but for more complex models, they are notoriously hard to compute
- The fact that they are highly sensitive to the choice of priors + the fact that finding an "alternative" model is not at all trivial + that computing them is often very hard have been seen as **limitations** and made them the focal point of debates (even between Bayesians)
- There are different schools: 
  - Some Bayesians believe that BFs are the best indices ever (assuming one understands them) and the Graal of Bayesian statistics
  - Some believe that other indices are better and that BFs reproduce the same culture of binary thinking as Frequentist NHST
  - We'll adopt a middle view: BFs are useful, in particular for simple tests, but they are not the only good thing in Bayesian statistics

## Exercice {background-color="#FFAB91"}

- Compute and report the Bayes Factor for the correlation between `Sepal.Length` and `Sepal.Width` from the `iris` dataset.

```{r}
#| include: false

BayesFactor::correlationBF(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width)
```




## Recap

- $\underbrace{\frac{P(H_1 | D)}{P(H_0 | D)}}_{posterior} = \underbrace{\frac{P(D | H_1)}{P(D | H_0)}}_{Bayes~Factor} \cdot \underbrace{\frac{P(H_1)}{P(H_0)}}_{prior}$
- We have seen what Bayes Factors are
- We have seen how we can place *priors* on parameters (e.g., for correlations)
- But... what about the *posterior*?
