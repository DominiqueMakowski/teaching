## Installing `brms`

::: {.nonincremental}

- Restart R (Environment should be empty)

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# In a FRESH session:
# 1.
install.packages("brms")

# 2.
library(brms)

# 3.
brm(mpg ~ wt, data=mtcars)
```


- It should prompt you with installing additional tools. Say yes. It should start downloading, and then installing automatically
- **If prompted again, say no.**
- During or after the installation, it might throw an error. Just wait until the installation is complete
- Close R and RStudio
- Reopen, and run 🤞

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# 4.
library(brms)
brm(mpg ~ wt, data=mtcars)
```

## Recap {background-color="#1A237E"}

- Frequentist statistics assume that the the parameters of a model are **fixed** (but unknown) and that the data are **random** samples from a fixed **parent distribution**.
- Most Frequentist null-hypothesis testing procedures are based on **distributional assumptions**.
- We compute some point estimate (e.g., *t*-value) and use it to find answers (e.g., probability of being superior to a threshold) using **analytical distributions** (e.g., a *t*-distribution with certain parameters).
- Using analytical distributions allows us to **compute exact answers** as the probability function (PDF), the quantile function, etc., are known and mathematically tractable (i.e., we can compute exact results with functions like `pnorm()`, `qnorm()`, `pt()`, `dt()`, etc.).

## Example: Correlations

- A correlation measures the **strength** of the linear relationship between two variables.
- A Pearson correlation coefficient (*r*) can be computed with the formula:
- $r = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}$

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

x <- c(3, 4, 5, 6, 3, 2) #  Any vector of values
y <- c(3, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3) # Another vector of values

# Calculate Pearson's correlation coefficient using the formula
n <- length(x)
x_bar <- mean(x)
y_bar <- mean(y)

r <- sum((x - x_bar) * (y - y_bar)) / sqrt(sum((x - x_bar)^2) * sum((y - y_bar)^2))
r
```

:::

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

cor(x, y)
```

:::

## Correlation Test

- The *t*-value of a correlation is computed as: $t = \frac{r \sqrt{n - 2}}{\sqrt{1 - r^2}}$
- The *t*-value can be seen as a "standardized" index of coefficient precision (adjusted for the sample size *n*). 
- We can then use the Probability function *p* of the corresponding *t*-distribution to compute $p > |t|$.

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Calculate the t-value
t_value <- r * sqrt(n - 2) / sqrt(1 - r^2)
t_value

# Calculate the p-value
p_value <- 2 * pt(abs(t_value), df = n - 2, lower.tail = FALSE)
p_value
```

:::

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

cor.test(x, y)
```

:::


## Using the `{correlation}` package

- `{correlation}` is part of the `easystats` collection of packages, and allows to run various types of correlations, and to plot the results.
- Contrary to base R's `cor.test()`, `cor_test()` takes the data as a first argument and the variable names next.

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

results <- correlation::cor_test(mtcars, "mpg", "qsec")
results
```

:::

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

plot(results)
```

:::

## Extract the correlation value

- The `cor_test()` function returns a data.frame, so it's easy to extract values

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

actual_r <- results$r
actual_r
```

:::

## Parent Population

- Frequentist "inferential" statistics are used to make inferences about the **parent population** from which the data are **sampled**<sup><sub>(this is a difference with the Bayesian framework, but more on that later)</sub></sup>
- We use a lot of assumptions about how the effects (and absence thereof) are distributed for the *parent population*, which allows us to estimate things like confidence intervals and p-values.
- If we had access to the *parent populations*, we wouldn't need to compute these indices, we would just say this is the "true" value of the effect.
- But we usually don't have access to the parent population, and we have to rely on the data at hand (assumed to be a **random sample** from the parent distribution) and infer/assume the shape of the parent distribution

## "Data are random"

- This assumption has an interesting consequence...
- Data points can be seen as "**interchangeable**"!
- We could make a new sample from the same data points

```{r}
set.seed(123)
```

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

# New samples will be the same number of obs, but randomly different rows
new_obs <- sample(1:nrow(mtcars), replace = TRUE)
new_obs
```

:::

- Create a new dataset...

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

new_sample <- mtcars[new_obs, ]
```

:::

- and compute the correlation again...

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

new_sample |> 
  correlation::cor_test("mpg", "qsec")
```

:::


## Rince and repeat

- What happens if we repeat this process many times?

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

r_values <- c()  # Initialize an empty vector of r values
for (i in 1:5000) {  # Repeat the process 5000 times
  new_sample <- mtcars[sample(1:nrow(mtcars), replace = TRUE), ]  # Sample new data
  result <- correlation::cor_test(new_sample, "mpg", "qsec")  # Compute the correlation
  r_values <- c(r_values, result$r)  # Append the r value to the vector
}
```

:::

## Quizz {background-color="#FFAB91"}

::: {.nonincremental .stretch}

- Run this code, and plot the distribution of the series of *r* values

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

r_values <- c()  # Initialize an empty vector of r values
for (i in 1:5000) {  # Repeat the process 5000 times
  new_sample <- mtcars[sample(1:nrow(mtcars), replace = TRUE), ]  # Sample new data
  result <- correlation::cor_test(new_sample, "mpg", "qsec")  # Compute the correlation
  r_values <- c(r_values, result$r)  # Append the r value to the vector
}
```

- Hint: use `data.frame(r = r_values)` to create a dataframe with the vector of *r* values (that you can pass to `ggplot()`)

:::

## Solution {background-color="#80DEEA"}


```{r}
#| echo: true

p <- data.frame(r = r_values) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = r)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "grey", color = "darkgrey") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = actual_r, color = "red", linetype="dashed") +

## Bootstrapping

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

![](img/bootstrapping.png)

::::

:::: {.column}

- The process of sampling **with replacement**^[otherwise it is the same as the original data] from the data a new sample of the same size to compute a **distribution** for the statistical index of interest is called **bootstrapping**
  - Why do we sample *with replacement*?
- The term "**bootstrapping**" comes from the impossible act of "**pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps!**", which refers to the process of randomly resampling your own dataset to create many simulated datasets from which we can obtain meaningful results.

::::

:::

## Why bootstrapping?

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

- Instead of having a **point-estimate** of a statistical parameter (in our case a correlation coefficient *r*), we now have a **distribution** of the statistic
  - Note: an empirical distribution (i.e., just a bunch of numbers)
- This distribution is valid (flows from the premises of frequentist statistics) and can be used to directly estimate the uncertainty related to the statistic of interest
- From now on, you need to shift your thinking from "point-estimates" (single values) to start thinking in terms of "distribution" of statistical values
- How to describe this distribution?

## Describing a distribution of statistics

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

- How can we describe the distribution of statistics?
- Ideally, we would always have visualizations (using a histogram / density plot)
  - Not the most convenient in reports and tables
- We need to compute **descriptive indices**
- We usually still compute a point-estimate, useful to give an idea of the "central tendency" of the distribution <sub><sup>*(as our little brains don't process well uncertainty and ranges)*</sup></sub>
- Which one? [**Mean? Median? Mode?**]{.fragment}

::::

:::: {.column}

```{r}
#| echo: false

```


::::

:::

## Indices of Centrality - Mean

- The **mean** is a common index of centrality
- Pros: 
  - Easy to compute
  - Easy to interpret ("average" value)
  - It is an important mathematical property
- Cons:
  - Sensitive to outliers
  - Not suitable for discrete distributions (e.g. counts: `mean(c(0, 0, 1, 4, 6))`)
  - Not the most appropriate for non-symmetric distributions

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

r_mean
```

:::

## Indices of Centrality - Mean

```{r}
#| echo: true

p <- p + geom_vline(xintercept = r_mean, color = "blue") 
p
```


## Indices of Centrality - Median

- The **median** is the value that separates the distribution in two halves
- Pros: 
  - Easy to compute
  - Robust to outliers
  - Consistent interpretation in terms of probabilities (50% of the values are below and above the median value)
  - "There are 50% chances that the value of the statistic is above the median"
- Cons:
  - Too robust? (to variability in the tails)

```{r}
#| echo: true

r_median <- median(r_values)
r_median
```

:::

## Indices of Centrality - Median

```{r}
#| echo: true

p <- p + geom_vline(xintercept = r_median, color = "orange") 
p
```




## Indices of Centrality - Mode/MAP

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="50%"}

- The **mode** is the most frequent value in the distribution
- For continuous distribution, it is meaningless (as the probability of having exactly the same value is very low)
- The equivalent for continuous distributions is called the "**maximum a posteriori**" (**MAP**)
- It corresponds to the most probable value, based on the density estimation of the statistic

## Indices of Centrality - Mode/MAP

- Pros: 
  - Interpretation: "the most likely value"
- Cons:
  - Complex to compute (need to estimate the density of the distribution)
  - Problematic for multimodal distributions
  - Not really robust
  - Not always defined (e.g. uniform distributions)
- Can be computed using the `{bayestestR}` package (in *easystats*)

::: {.fragment}


```{r}
#| echo: true

r_map <- as.numeric(bayestestR::map_estimate(r_values))
r_map

::: {.fragment}
:::: {.callout-warning}

The `map_estimate()` function does not return a numeric value. The MAP value can be extracted using `as.numeric()`.

## Indices of Centrality - Mode/MAP

```{r}
#| echo: true

p <- p + geom_vline(xintercept = r_map, color = "purple") 
p
```

## Which one(s) to pick?

::: {.stretch}

- 🤷
- Each index has its pros and cons. No consensus on which one is "better" 
- In some cases, these indices of centrality tend to converge (e.g. for symmetric distributions)
  - E.g., in a normal distribution, the mean, median and mode are the same
- In other cases, they can be quite different

:::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| fig.height: 3

data <- data.frame(x = bayestestR::distribution_beta(10000, 1.5, 6))
indices <- data.frame(Index = c("Mean", "Median", "MAP"), 
                      Value = c(mean(data$x), median(data$x), as.numeric(bayestestR::map_estimate(data$x))))

data |> 
  ggplot(aes(x)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=60, color="darkgrey", fill="grey") +
  geom_vline(data = indices, aes(xintercept = Value, color = Index), size = 1) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("purple", "green", "blue")) +
  theme_bw()
```

::::
:::

## Indices of Dispersion

- It is also useful to describe the **dispersion** of the distribution
- In MLE, we computed the **standard error** of the statistic, which is...
  - The standard deviation of a summary statistic (e.g., the dispersion of means of many distributions)
  - The standard deviation of the statistic "if we repeated the experiment an infinite number of times"
- When bootstrap is used, we can directly compute the **standard deviation** of the distribution of the statistic

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

sd(r_values)  # The equivalent of the SE in traditional frequentist models
```

:::

## Indices of Dispersion - MAD

- The **median absolute deviation** (**MAD**) is an alternative index of dispersion
- It is "median-based": it corresponds to the median of the absolute deviations from the median
- It shares some properties with the median, such as being more robust to outliers than the SD

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

mad(r_values)
```

:::

- People tend to be consistent and use either **Mean \& SD** or **Median \& MAD**

## Credible Interval (CI)

- Since we have the distribution of the statistic at hand, we can also directly compute a **credible interval** (**CI**), i.e., a range where values are "likely" to be found. 
- It is the equivalent of the *Confidence* Interval, but with more straightforward interpretation
  - The interpretation for a 95% **Confidence** Interval would be *"there is a 95% probability that when computing a confidence interval from data of this sort, the effect falls within this range"*
  - The interpretation for a 95% **Credible** Interval would be *"there is a 95% probability that the effect falls within this range"*
- Note that **Credible Interval** is mostly used in a **Bayesian context** (where we measure actual beliefs about probabilities, hence the name "credible"). In a Frequentist context, we would rather use the **Bootstrapped Confidence Interval**.
  - I will continue using **Credible** just so that you don't confuse it with normal parametric **Confidence Intervals**

## Credible Interval - ETI

- The **Equal-Tailed Interval** (**ETI**) is the commonly used as an index of CI because of its computational simplicity
- It is made by exclusing an **equal amount data from each tail** of the distribution.
- Typically, we do a 95% CI, which excludes 2.5% from each tail of the distribution.
- It is the range of values that contains 95% of the distribution (i.e., the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles)
- It can be computed using the `bayestestR::eti()` function

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

bayestestR::eti(data, ci = 0.95)
```

:::

## Credible Interval - ETI 

- It works well for symmetric distributions, but can be problematic for skewed distributions
- For example, it can exclude "high probability" regions of the distribution, which is counter-intuitive

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true

data <- data.frame(x = bayestestR::distribution_beta(10000, 3, 20))

ci_eti <- bayestestR::eti(data)

bayestestR::estimate_density(data$x, method="logspline") |> 
  mutate(ETI = ifelse(x > ci_eti$CI_high, "Higher", ifelse(x < ci_eti$CI_low, "Lower", "Within CI"))) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=x, y=y)) +
  geom_area(aes(fill = ETI)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Lower"="#2196F3", "Higher"="#03A9F4", "Within CI"="#F44336")) +
  labs(fill = "95% ETI", x="Bootstrapped distribution of r coefficients", y="Probability") +
  theme_bw() 
```

:::

## Credible Interval - HDI


- The **Highest Density Interval** (**HDI**) is an alternative index of CI that is more robust to skewed distributions and more intuitive
- It is the range of values that contains 95% of the distribution and has the highest density

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

bayestestR::hdi(data)
```

:::

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| fig.height: 3

ci_hdi <- bayestestR::hdi(data)

bayestestR::estimate_density(data$x, method="logspline") |> 
  mutate(HDI = ifelse(x > ci_hdi$CI_high, "Higher", ifelse(x < ci_hdi$CI_low, "Lower", "Within CI"))) |>

  geom_area(aes(fill = HDI)) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.95, color="black", linetype="dashed") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Lower"="#4CAF50", "Higher"="#8BC34A", "Within CI"="#F44336")) +
  labs(fill = "95% HDI", x="Bootstrapped distribution of r coefficients", y="Probability") +
  theme_bw() 
```

:::


## Credible Interval - Which type to use?

- For symmetric distributions, the ETI and HDI are equivalent
- HDI is overall more "intuitive", as it tells the range of values that contains 95% of the most probable values
- But ETI is simpler to compute, and hence is often the default in many software


## Why 95% CI?

- **Why do we use "95%" (0.95) for the CI?**
- Because of the .05 alpha level (used for the *p*-value)
- Indeed, confidence intervals have a direct relationship with the *p*-value: 
  - if the 95% CI is $[0.00, x]$ or $[x, 0.00]$, then the *p*-value = .05. 
  - In other words, a 0.95 CI excluding 0 has a *p*-value < .05.
- But this .05 alpha level is arbitrary...
  - Yes. And so is 95%. It is mostly a *convention*.
- Recently, a trend emerged to "shake up" the conventions and highlight the arbitrary nature of the .05 alpha level
  - McElreath (2018) suggested to use **89% CI** instead of 95% CI. *Why?* [**Because why not!**]{.fragment}
- Some software also use 90% or 94% CI as default
- However, I still personally recommends 95% 
  - See **https://github.com/easystats/bayestestR/discussions/250**
- **Importantly**, the choice of the CI is for you to decide.



## Recap {background-color="#1A237E"}

- Bootstrapping allow us to obtain a **distribution** of statistics of interest (e.g., correlation coefficients), instead of a single value
- Having a distribution allows us to directly compute useful descriptive indices, without relying on complex assumptions and analytical solutions
- We describe a distribution of parameters with:
  - An index of **centrality** (e.g., mean, median, MAP)
  - An index of **dispersion** (e.g., SD, MAD)
  - A range of **uncertainty** (e.g., Credible Intervals using ETIs or HDIs)
- What is missing?
  - Significance?
  - Effect size?

## How certain are we of the *direction* of the effect?

- Having a distribution of effects allows us to gain information about its **direction**
- The **direction** of the effect is the sign of the effect (e.g., positive or negative)
- How can we compute it?
  - We can simply compute the proportion of the distribution that is positive or negative

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Remember: TRUE = 1 and FALSE = 0
# So we can count all TRUE by summing them
sum(r_values > 0)  / length(r_values)
```

:::

## Probability of Direction (pd)

```{r}
#| include: false

pd <- sum(r_values > 0)  / length(r_values)
```

- The probability that the correlation is positive (regardless of its size) is `r insight::format_value(pd, digits=6)`
  - $P_{(direction > 0)}$ `r insight::format_pd(pd, name="")`
- This index is actually called the **Probability of Direction** (**pd**)
- It is defined as the probability that the effect is positive or negative (whichever is the largest)
- It varies between 0.50 (50\%) and 1.00 (100\%), with 0.50 indicating that the effect is equally likely to be positive or negative, and 100\% indicating that the effect is for sure positive or negative
- We can conceptualize it as an **index of effect existence** (i.e., how likely is the effect to exist in a given direction *regardless* of its size)
  - If $pd \rightarrow 100\%$, it means that there is certainly a positive|negative effect (but it can be small, large, or its size can be uncertain)

## *pd* vs. *p*-value

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

- Although **conceptually distinct**, the *pd* typically very strongly correlates with one-sided *p*-values
  - But it is **not** an index of **significance** (the interpretation is more straightforward)
- For example, if the *pd* is > 97.5\% (0.975), then the *p*-value is typically < .05
  - $p_{onesided} = 1 - pd$
  - $p_{twosided} = 2(1 - pd)$
- A function `bayestestR` exists to convert between the two indices. 
  - Use it only to gain an intuition, **is it not a formal conversion**

<!-- Talk about advantages and limitations when we re-introduce these indices in the context of Bayesian statistics
-->

```{r}
#| echo: true

## Probability of null effect?

- The *pd* tells us the probability that a distribution (of an effect) is positive (> 0) or negative (< 0)
- Can we know if the effect is larger or smaller than **zero**?
- In other words, can we know the probability of the effect being different from 0? 
  - Which is the goal of **Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST)**
- Well, ***not really***...
  - The probability of a continuous distribution being different from a single value is always **infinite**
  - Infinity of values vs. a single one, exactly 0.0000
- What can we do?
  - What if instead of considering "no effect" as being exactly 0.0000, we consider it as being "close to 0.0000"?
  - What if we defined a range of "negligible" values, **equivalent to 0 for practical** purposes?
  - This is the idea behind the **Region of Practical Equivalence** (**ROPE**)

- The idea of the ROPE is to **explicitly** define a range that we consider as "negligible" (i.e., equivalent to 0 for practical purposes)
- For instance, say I decide to define a **parameter < 0.24** as negligible <sub><sup>*because why not?*</sup></sub>
  - Justified based on e.g., prior studies, preliminary data, theoretical knowledge, ...
  - I *preregister* this hypothesis (so that I am not accused of making this choice after seeing the results)
- What is the probability of $parameter < |0.24|$?

## ROPE + CI = <3

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="40%"}

- We often compute the proportion of a certain **Credible Interval** that lies within the ROPE
- The ROPE index is often computed as the **95\% CI** of the distribution that lies within the ROPE bounds
  - Because the CI is considered to be more stable than the whole distribution, and thus the resulting index is less prone to small random fluctuations
- **Be careful** when reading and presenting results involving ROPE: what is the ROPE range and the CI used?

## Is p-ROPE an index of significance?

- This index corresponds to the **proportion of the distribution/Credible Interval that is within the ROPE**
- *p*-ROPE ($P_{x~\in~ROPE}$) can be interpreted as an index of **significance**
  - The probability that an effect is non-negligible
  - i.e., "significant" is here meant in the sense of **"large enough to matter"** sense
  - Note that *p*-ROPE index is **not** equivalent or highly correlated with *p*-values
- Note that "**Equivalence Testing**" is sometimes presented as an alternative to Null-Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST), and can be also used with more traditional tests (with the idea of testing against a range of pre-specified "negligible" values instead of a point-null).


## ROPE range (1)

- In the previous example, I had reasons to pick `[-0.24, 0.24]` as the ROPE range
- In most studies, in practice, we don't have a clear reason to pick a specific range (especially in exploratory studies)
- How can we select a **reasonable** ROPE range?
- Let's think again about what we are doing:
  - We are trying to estimate a correlation *r*

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

r_values <- c()  # Initialize an empty vector of r values
for (i in 1:5000) {  # Repeat the process 5000 times
  result <- mtcars[sample(1:nrow(mtcars), replace = TRUE), ] |>  # Sample new data
    correlation::cor_test("mpg", "qsec")  # Compute the correlation
  r_values <- c(r_values, result$r)  # Append the r value to the vector
}
```

## ROPE range (2)

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

- Instead of a single value, we applied a bootstrapping algorithm and obtained a **distribution** of correlation values
- We are trying to describe this distribution using various indices
- But given the nature of the index that we are focusing on (a correlation), we can already know some things about the distribution
  - *r*-values are bounded between -1 and 1
  - They are "standardized" (i.e., invariant of the unit of the varialbes)
  - This is why they can be used as an index of effect size (similar to *Cohen's d*, $\eta^2$, etc.)

:::: {.column}

```{r}
#| echo: false

data.frame(r = r_values) |>

## ROPE range (3)

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

- We can use effect size "rules of thumb" to select a ROPE range
- Look for the help page of the `effectsize::interpret_r()` function
  - Select the function and press `F1`
  - Or use `?effectsize::interpret_r`
  - Or Google `effectsize package interpret_r`

## ROPE range (4)

- One of the most common rules of thumb is the one proposed by Cohen (1988) suggests that *r* < 0.1 is a very small (i.e., negligible) effect
- We can use this rule of thumb to select a ROPE range based on Cohen's (1988) interpretation guidelines `[-0.1, 0.1]`

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

bayestestR::rope(r_values, range = c(-0.1, 0.1), ci = 0.95)
```

:::

- If *p*-ROPE is lower than certain threshold (typically, `0.05`), we can conclude that the effect is not negligible (i.e., "significant")
- While this can be done for correlations, defining an appropriate ROPE range can become difficult for other types of parameters (e.g., regression coefficients)
- We will discuss the pros/cons of various "significance" indices later in the module

## Reporting

- How to report a bootstrapped correlation?

```

:::

- Describe the "centrality" (e.g;, Median), the "uncertainty" (CI), and the "significance" (e.g., ROPE, pd, ...)

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

bayestestR::describe_posterior(r_values, 
                               centrality="mean", 
                               dispersion=TRUE, 
                               ci=0.90, 
                               ci_method="hdi",
                               rope_range =c(-0.05, 0.05), 
                               test="rope")
```

- Choices must be made and justified: important to understand what the indices are and what they mean

## Bootstrapping-specific indices?

- Are these new indices (median, MAD, credible intervals, p-direction, ROPE) **bootstrapping**-specific?
  - **NO!** Bootstrapping is just a method that provides a parameter **distribution** instead of point-values
- These indices are "simply" descriptive summaries of parameter **distributions**
- Thus, they can be used whenever we have a distributions of parameters
- ⚠️**Spoiler Alert**⚠️ We will meet these indices again later in the module in another context...

## Boostrapping: pros and cons

- Is Bootstrapping the silver bullet of statistics?
- More robust (does not depend on parametric assumptions, e.g., *t*-distribution etc.), more flexible (can be used when analytical solutions are not available)
- Straightforward computation and interpretation of various descriptive indices (confidence intervals, etc.)
- Cons:
  - Computationally intensive (hence its "recent" development)
  - Allowed by the "frequentist assumption" that the data are a random sample from the parent population
  - In practice... it is not really the case. 
    - Sample data is often non randomly sampled
    - It is not always clear how to bootstrap (e.g., for repeated measures)
  - Although boostrapping has been demonstrated to work in many cases, it intuitively *feels* weird to consider the observations as "interchangeable" 
- Is there an alternative that combines some of the strengths of bootstrapping but without its weaknesses?
