## Recap {background-color="#003B49"}

::::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

- We understood how Bayes' Theorem can be used to update beliefs in light of new evidence
- How it can be used to compare models using Bayes Factors (BF) and use it in basic hypothesis tests (e.g., correlation)
- How we can set priors over parameters of interest (e.g., correlation coefficients) using distributions
- Started to understand why Bayes theory has wide applications beyond statistics (e.g., in neuroscience)

## Recap of Differences (1)

::: {.columns .nonincremental}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

- **Frequentist Statistics** 
  - Generate a sampling distribution of the test statistic assuming $H0$
  - Compare observed value of the test statistic with the sampling distribution 
  - Reject $H0$ if  probability of observed  value (or more extreme values) is less than $\alpha$
  - What we get: $p(data|Null Hypothesis)$
  - What we want to know: $p(Hypothesis|data)$
  
  
<!-- TODO: retrive quote that illustrates this -->
::::

:::: {.column}


- **Bayesian Statistics** 
  - Directly test hypotheses of interest: $p(H|data)$
  - Define prior over hypotheses $p(H)$
  - Compute likelihood of the data for each hypothesis $p(data|H)$
  - Use Bayes' rule to infer the posterior over hypotheses given the data $p(H|data)$

::::

:::


## Recap of Differences (2)

- Main difference is that it doesn't rely on complicated assumptions and algorithms to estimate parameters
- Instead, it relies on **Bayes' theorem** to compute the **posterior distribution** of the parameters of interest
- Frequentist estimation: Data * Model * Optimization Algorithm -> result (best fitting parameters) -> inference relies on further assumptions
- Bayesian estimation does not rely on assumptions, but instead, starts with initial "results" (priors), and then updates these results based on the data
- Every statistical parameter that we want to estimate has to start with a prior distribution

## History of Statistics

::: {.columns style="font-size: 90%;"}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

- **Frequentism**
  - 1900: Karl Pearson develops the chi-squared and correlation test
  - 1913: Ronald Fisher introduces the concept of likelihood
  - 1920s: Fisher develops maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and analysis of variance (ANOVA)
  - 1927: Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson (son of Karl Pearson) introduce hypothesis testing and confidence intervals
  - 1950s: Frequentism becomes the dominant statistical approach in most scientific disciplines

::::
:::: {.column width="50%"}

- **Bayesianism**
  - 1763: Thomas Bayes' essay "An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances" published posthumously
  - 1812: Pierre-Simon Laplace, a French mathematician and physicist, extended and formalized Bayesian probability theory
  - 1950s: Leonard Jimmie Savage lays the foundation for modern Bayesian statistics
  - 1960s: Work by Jeffrey explores the philosophical and practical aspects of Bayesian inference
  - 1980s: Bayesian statistics becomes increasingly applicable thanks to advancements in computing power and algorithms (MCMC)

## Why such a gap?


::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="70%"}

- We know the Bayes' theorem since the 18th century (actually predates Frequentist statistics)
- But Bayesian statistics really didn't appear until the 1960's, with a real boom in the 2000's
- Why did it take 250 years to take off?
- Because performing Bayesian inference for real data (not just estimating Bayes factors) is hard, and could only be achieved with the advent of modern computers

::::
:::: {.column width="30%"}

## Correlation


- The `BayesFactor` package allows us to compute Bayes factors using a mathematical trick without performing "full" Bayesian inference

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

result <- BayesFactor::correlationBF(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$qsec)
result
```

::: 

- $BF_{10} = 4.42$ is moderate evidence for the existence of a correlation...
  - But in what direction? Of what magnitude?
- What if we want to describe the correlation coefficient? 
- In a Bayesian context, this means to analyze our beliefs about the correlation coefficient after observing the data. [**Bayes' Theorem**: $\underbrace{P(H|data)}_{Posterior} = \underbrace{P(H)}_{Prior}~\underbrace{P(data|H)}_{Likelihood}$]{.fragment}
- This is called the **Posterior**, and is the last ingredient of Bayesian inference   - Priors \* (model + data) = Posterior

## Posterior Description

- The results obtained by `BayesFactor` don't contain the posterior, because it is not computed by default (the package focuses on estimating Bayes Factors in the most efficient way possible)
- We can compute it using the `posterior()` function and specifying the number of iterations (i.e., the number of "draws")

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

posterior <- BayesFactor::posterior(result, iterations=500)
head(posterior)
```

:::

## MCMC

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

- It performs the sampling using a technique called **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**, which is a family of algorithms that allow to sample from a distribution without knowing its exact shape.
- This is because, while we can calculate the exact Bayesian posterior of simple known distributions, it becomes very hard for **empirical distributions** (i.e., distributions that don't have a formula, such as that of the data).
- We say that the posterior is **intractable** (i.e., we can't compute it analytically using formulas).


::::

:::: {.column}

```{r}
#| echo: true

head(posterior)
```

- While the exact posterior distribution is intractable, we can approximate it by **drawing *n* random samples** from it
- This is what MCMC does, and this is why computational power is typically needed to perform Bayesian inference

::::

:::

## MCMC

- MCMC is a key milestone in the history of Bayesian statistics, because it allows us to perform Bayesian inference for complex models
- In general, "Bayesian sampling" is a hot area of research with lots of improvements and developments over the past & new couple of years
- MCMC is a family of algorithms^[https://chi-feng.github.io/mcmc-demo/app.html?algorithm=RandomWalkMH&target=banana], and the core idea is that we obtain a random sample from the (inaccessible) posterior distribution
- The more samples we have, the better the approximation of the posterior distribution is
- But sampling takes time: **often a tradeoff between accuracy and speed**


## Quizz {background-color="#FFAB91"}

- Doing Bayesian Statistics often involves describing the posterior distribution (the updated beliefs about some statistical parameters, e.g., the correlation value)
- Computing the posterior distribution is easy and can be done with formulas
- In real-world problems, the exact posterior distribution is *intractable* (i.e., we can't compute it analytically using formulas)
- Not being able to compute the posterior analytically means that we cannot draw random samples from this distribution
- Drawing many samples from the posterior allows us to get an empirical approximation of the posterior distribution
- The process of random sampling is called **York Chain Monte Altro (YMCA)**
- The process of random sampling is called **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**



## MCMC Chains Inspection

::: {.columns style="font-size: 90%;"}
:::: {.column width="50%"}

- MCMC is a process that should be inspected to ensure that it is working properly
- It can go wrong (e.g., not converged)

::::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

head(posterior)
```

:::::

- In the example above, we have drawn 500 samples from the posterior distribution
- The returned object shows us the values of 2 variables, the correlation coefficient `rho` and `zeta` (a transformed version of the correlation coefficient that is not important)

::::
:::: {.column width="50%"}

::::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

plot(posterior)
```

:::::

- The plot on the right is the density plot of the parameter, and on the left it shows the **"trace plots"** of the MCMC chain
- Trace plots should look like "Hairy Caterpillars", i.e., stationary (overall flat) and "random" (noisy)
- **Put a pin in that**: We will come back to "model diagnostic" in the future

::::
:::


## Posterior Description

- Once we **assessed our sampling process** and made sure the posterior has been correctly explored and sampled from, we can proceed to **visualize and describe** the posterior distribution

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-height: 3

data <- as.data.frame(posterior)

p <- data |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=rho)) +
  geom_density(fill="purple") +
  geom_vline(xintercept=0, linetype="dashed") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x="Correlation Coefficient", y="Probability") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(-1, 1))
p
```

:::

## Add Prior

```{r}
#| echo: true

rscale <- 1/3

prior <- data.frame(
  y = dbeta(seq(0, 1, length.out=100), 1/rscale, 1/rscale),
  x = seq(-1, 1, length.out=100)
)

p + 
  geom_area(data=prior, aes(x=x, y=y), fill="orange", alpha=.4) +
  labs(title="Beliefs about rho before (orange) and after (purple) seeing the data")
```



## Impact of Prior on Posterior

::: {.nonincremental style="font-size: 90%;"}
- As we have seen, priors and models specification have a strong influence on Bayes Factors
- But they also have an impact on the posterior distribution

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true

simulate_results <-  function(V1, V2) {
  
  # Initialize dataframes
  data_priors <- data.frame()
  data_posteriors <- data.frame()
  
  for(rscale in c(0.05, 0.1, 1/sqrt(27), 1/3, 1/sqrt(3), 1)) {
    # Prior
    prior <- data.frame(
      y = dbeta(seq(0, 1, length.out=100), 1/rscale, 1/rscale),
      x = seq(-1, 1, length.out=100),
      rscale = insight::format_value(rscale)
    )
    # prior$y <- prior$y / max(prior$y)  # Normalize y (for visualization)
    data_priors <- rbind(data_priors, prior)
    
    # Compute results
    result <- BayesFactor::correlationBF(V1, V2, rscale=rscale)
    
    # Sample posterior
    posterior <- as.data.frame(BayesFactor::posterior(result, iterations=2000))
    posterior$rscale <- insight::format_value(rscale)
    data_posteriors <- rbind(data_posteriors, posterior)
  }
  
  # Make plot
  ggplot(data_priors, aes(color=rscale)) +
    geom_line(aes(x=x, y=y), linewidth=1, linetype="dashed") +
    geom_density(data=data_posteriors, aes(x=rho), alpha=.2, linewidth=2) +
    theme_bw() +
    labs(x="Correlation Coefficient", y="Probability") +
    coord_cartesian(xlim=c(-1, 1))

## Priors and Posteriors

- Priors have an effect, especially when evidence from data is weak (e.g., small sample size)
- This is why we say that "Bayesian statistics are useful when we have little data"
  - This is because we can set informative priors based on our knowledge that can help us make better inferences
  - But if there is clear evidence from the data, the prior doesn't matter that much
<!-- - **"If the data speaks clearly, Bayes will hear it"** -->
- The more data, the higher our posterior precision (narrower posterior = lower **uncertainty**)
- This is where Bayesian statistics shine: they allow us to quantify the uncertainty associated with our estimates by describing the posterior distribution (in particular, its width)

## Priors and Posteriors

::: {.columns}
 
:::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 90%;"}

- Bayesian inference is often intuitively conceptualized as a **mixture** between a prior distribution (**expectations**) and a "likelihood" distribution (representing the **evidence**, i.e., the data given a model), which result in the posterior distribution
- This posterior is seen as a compromise between the prior and the likelihood (i.e., the data)
- In neuroscience, this is often used in the context of the "Bayesian brain" hypothesis, which posits that the brain is a Bayesian inference machine that has prior expectations (e.g., about what it's going to hear), that gets confronted to sensory evidence (the noisy data coming from the ears), and resolves this: what we consciously hear is the "posterior" distribution that combines the prior and the evidence

- Normal prior, normal likelihood

  - $\mu \sim Normal(10,1)$
- Can you guess the shape of the posterior?

- Now the likelihood dominates: it's thin tails are very skeptical of the prior, but the prior's thick tails are not surprised by the likelihood

![](img/intuitionGame4b.png)

- The two modes persist: the extra mass in the tails means each distribution finds the other's mode more plausible and so the average isn't the best "compromise"

## Posterior Description

```{r}
#| echo: false

p + 
  geom_area(data=prior, aes(x=x, y=y), fill="orange", alpha=.4) +
  labs(title="Beliefs about rho before (orange) and after (purple) seeing the data")
```

- How can we describe and report this correlation test?
- We can report the posterior distribution of the correlation coefficient
- We could (and should) visualize it, but we also often need to report it with numbers (e.g., in a paper)
- Because it is "just" a distribution, we can re-use the concepts that we have seen for **bootstrapping**
- We need to report various indices to convey as much information as we can about this distribution

## Indices of Centrality

::: {style="font-size: 90%"}

- We want to describe the "center" / "typical" value of the posterior distribution
- What indices to you know?
- **Mean**

:::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Extract the vector of rho values
rvals <- as.data.frame(posterior)$rho

mean(rvals)
```

::::

  - **Median**

:::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

median(rvals)
```

::::

  - (Mode) **MAP** (Maximum A *Posteriori*)

:::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

as.numeric(bayestestR::map_estimate(rvals))
```

::::

- Which one to pick?
  - **Up to you!** But be mindful.
- I recommend the median because it is less jittery and has a probabilistic meaning (the effect has 50% to be lower and 50% to be higher)

:::

## Point-estimates - Note


- The index of centrality that we reported is often referred to as a "point-estimate" of the parameter's central tendency (e.g., "the" correlation coefficient)
  - *Note that we can also talk about "point-estimates of dispersion" etc., point-estimate just means "single value" summary*
- When re-used (in other analyses, meta-analyses, ...), it inevitably carries a loss of information (e.g., uncertainty).
  - E.g., computing the Bayesian correlation within each participant between RT and number of errors, and then using the "point-estimate" to further relate it to personality traits
- Unfortunately, *propagating uncertainty* is not common practice (and is technically challenging)


## Indices of Uncertainty - Deviation

- We want to describe the "uncertainty" / "variability" of the posterior distribution
- This informs us about the "precision" of our estimate
- **What index?**
- **Standard deviation**: the SD of the posterior is the "equivalent"\*\* of the standard error (SE) in Frequentist models. But its interpretation is more straightforward: it is the average distance of the values from the mean. Whereas the Frequentist SE is the deviation of sample means if we drew infinite samples from the parent population (which is a bit more abstract).

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

sd(rvals)
```

:::



- **MAD**: the Median Absolute Deviation is the median of the absolute deviations from the median. It is more robust to outliers than the SD.

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

mad(rvals)
```

:::

## Indices of Uncertainty - Intervals (Range)

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

- One can also communicate uncertainty by reporting "credibility" (i.e., certainty) intervals
- What bounds? 95%? 90%? 89%?

::::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

ci <- bayestestR::eti(rvals, ci=c(0.50, 0.89, 0.90, 0.95))
plot(ci)
```

:::::

::::

:::: {.column}

- 95% is the most common (because it has been used in Frequentist statistics), but it is ultimately **arbitrary**^[Even though one can find reasons to prefer this]
- 89% has been advocated by Richard McElreath as an iconoclast move to break the 95% tradition
- Some people report multiple intervals (especially via plots), to help conveying the shape of the distribution
- (I recommend 95%)

::::

:::

## Indices of Uncertainty - Intervals (Type)

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

- **What type of interval?**
- **Equal-tailed intervals (ETI)**: Quantiles are values that split the distribution into equal parts (e.g., the 2.5% quantile is the value below which 2.5% of the distribution lies). Quantile-based intervals are commonly used to report the 95% most "central" values of the posterior distribution (i.e., the 95% quantile interval). They are called "equal-tailed" because they contain the same amount of probability mass on each side of the distribution.

::::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

bayestestR::eti(rvals)
```

:::::


::::

:::: {.column}

- Caveat: While easy to compute and to interpret, it is possible that values outside the ETI range are more probable than values inside (if the distribution is highly skewed)


::::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

x <- rgamma(10000, 1, 1000) * 10000

ci <- bayestestR::eti(x, ci=0.50)
plot(ci)
```

:::::

::::

:::

## Indices of Uncertainty - Intervals (Type)

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

- **Highest Density Interval (HDI)**: the HDI is the Bayesian equivalent of the Confidence Interval (CI). It is the interval that contains the specified probability mass (e.g., 95%) and has the highest density (i.e., is the narrowest). It is the most common interval reported in Bayesian analyses.
- The HDI is not straightforward to compute (is based on density estimation which is not a trivial issue)
- But is has the advantage of showing the most "credible" values: the values in the range are the most probable

::::

:::: {.column}

::::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

ci <- bayestestR::hdi(x, ci=0.50)
plot(ci)
```

:::::

- It is the most "intuitive" interval, and people often interpret Freqentist CIs as HDIs, which is not correct

::::

:::

## Indices of Effect "Significance"

- Indices useful to make a decision about the effect (whether it is worth mentioning and discussing or not)
  - This can mean either an effect being *big* enough ("significant")
    - Relates to the concept of effect size
  - Or an effect being *certain* enough (e.g., "a positive correlation *exists* for sure, even if very very small")
- **Bayes Factor (BF)**
- **Probability of Direction** (pd)
- Probability of being in the **Region Of Practical Equivalence** (ROPE)
- The two latter are "posterior-based indices", as they only require the posterior distribution to be computed (although the ROPE requires the specification of a "practical equivalence" range). They are often opposed to Bayes Factors, which requires the specification of an alternative models and cannot be computed from the posterior.

## Probability of Direction (pd)

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

- The probability that the effect is positive or negative
- It is a Bayesian equivalent usually strongly correlated with the *p*-value

  
::::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

rez <- bayestestR::pd(rvals)
plot(rez)
rez
```

:::::

::::

:::: {.column}

- Interpretation rules of thumb^[Makowski et al., (2019). *Indices of effect existence and significance in the Bayesian framework*. Frontiers in psychology, 10, 2767.]
  - **pd <= 95%** ~ *p* > .1: uncertain
  - **pd > 95%** ~ *p* < .1: possibly existing
  - **pd > 97%** ~ *p* < .06: likely existing
  - **pd > 99%** ~ *p* < .02: probably existing
  - **pd > 99.9%** ~ *p* < .002: certainly existing
- The *pd* is a good index because of its simplicity and its intuitive interpretation 

::::

:::

## ROPE (Region Of Practical Equivalence)

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

- The ROPE is a range of values that are considered as "practically equivalent" to zero (or to any other value)
- It is used to make a decision about the effect being "big" enough (i.e., "significant")

::::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

rez <- bayestestR::rope(rvals, rope=c(-0.1, 0.1))
rez
```

:::::

- Often we use $P_{~in~rope}< .05$ (= $5\%$) as a threshold

:::: 

:::: {.column}

::::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

plot(rez)
```

:::::

- Be careful, by default we consider some \% of CI that is in the ROPE, so your p-ROPE highly depends on the CI bounds you choose

::::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

bayestestR::rope(rvals, rope=c(-0.1, 0.1), ci=0.90)
bayestestR::rope(rvals, rope=c(-0.1, 0.1), ci=0.89)
```

## Decision Fatigue

- *"I hate Bayesian stats because there is so many things to decide / pay attention to"*
- There is even more things we ***should*** care about in Frequentist estimation
- The things we care about in Bayesian statistics are much more transparently accessible and interpretable (e.g., priors, MCMC diagnostics, posterior description, ...)
- Because applied Bayesian stats are a new field, there is not yet a very strong "standard" way to do things
- It is a moving and rapidly evolving field
- For now, best way to deal with this is to 1) understand the main concepts and indices, 2) be transparent about the choices you make
- Rest assured: if a result is really there, details of the approach shouldn't matter as much, the effect should show regardless of small variations in the analysis

## Sampling Information

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

- [x] Mention what algorithm and how many samples
  - *"We drew 500 samples using MCMC"*
  - *"The sampling algorithm (MCMC; 500 iterations) converged."*
- [x] Trace plots are mostly for you to assess convergence, but should not necessarily be reported

::::: {.fragment}


```{r}
#| echo: true

plot(posterior)
```

:::::

:::: 

:::: {.column}

- Make trace plot with `ggplot`
  - Plot the iterations "in order" of their sampling (from 1 to *i*)

::::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

data.frame(r=rvals, i=1:length(rvals)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=i, y=r)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title="Trace Plot of the Posterior Distribution")
```

## Posterior Distribution

- [x] If possible, show the posterior distribution

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

data.frame(r=rvals) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=r)) +
  geom_density(fill="orange") +
  labs(title="Correlation Posterior Distribution")
```

## Centrality and Direction

- [x] Index of centrality
  - Mean, median, MAP
  - *"The median of the correlation coefficient's posterior distribution is `r insight::format_value(median(rvals))`"*
  - *"We will report the median of the posterior distributions"* + *"The correlation was positive and significant (r = `r insight::format_value(median(rvals))`, ...)"*
- [x] Report correlation direction
  - Of the centrality point-estimate
  - "*The median of the correlation coefficient's posterior distribution is positive (r = `r insight::format_value(median(rvals))`)*
  - Using the *Probability of Direction* (**pd**) index
  - "*The probability of the correlation coefficient being positive (pd) is `r insight::format_pd(as.numeric(bayestestR::pd(rvals)), name=NULL)`*"
  
## Precision

- [x] Index of dispersion
  - SD, MAD
  - *"(MAD = `r insight::format_value(mad(rvals))`)"*
- [x] Credible Interval
  - HDI, ETI
  - *"95% HDI = [..., ...]"*
  - *"Credible intervals were computed as Highest Density Intervals (HDI)"* + *"95% CI = [..., ...]"*

## Effect significance

- [x] ROPE
  - *"The ROPE was set as [-0.10, 0.10] following Cohen's (1988) effect size recommendations for correlations and we computed the portion of the 95% CI lying inside as an index of effect significance"* + *"(p-ROPE=...)"*
  - *"The proportion of the posterior falling in the region of practical null equivalence (ROPE = [-0.10, 0.10]) is ..."*
- [x] Bayes Factor
  - *"There is strong evidence against the null hypothesis that the correlation is null (BF10 = ...)"*

## Effect size

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true

effectsize::interpret_r(median(rvals), rules="cohen1988")
```


- [x] Effect size interpretation
  - Mention rules: *"We labelled the correlation effect sizes using Cohen's (1988) rules of thumb set"*
  - Of the point-estimate
  - "*The median of the correlation coefficient's posterior distribution is positive and moderate"* 

:::: 

:::: {.column}

- Of the posterior distribution


::::: {.fragment}


```{r}
#| echo: true

effsizes_alldraws <- effectsize::interpret_r(rvals, rules="cohen1988") 
head(effsizes_alldraws)
length(effsizes_alldraws)
```

:::::

::::: {.fragment}


```{r}
#| echo: true

table(effsizes_alldraws) / length(effsizes_alldraws)
```

:::::

- *"The correlation has a 13.6% probability of being large, 51.8% of being moderate, 29.2% of being small and 5.40% of being very small"*
  - Can become verbose (especially if many correlations to report): **find good balance between detail and conciseness**

:::

## Minimal Template Sentence

- "The Bayesian Pearson correlation between X and Y was estimated to be r = *median* (95% CI [..., ...]), with a probability of ***pd*** of being negative and can be considered as significant ($p_{-rope}$=...)"
- "There was moderate evidence ($BF_{10}=~...$) in favour of a non-null correlation between X and Y that has a probability of ***pd*** of being negative (Median = median, 89% CI [..., ...]) and can be considered as significant and moderate  ($p_{-rope}$=...)"

## Spearman Correlation

- What are the benefits of Spearman correlations?
  - More "robust" to outliers

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

y <- c(0.53, 0.67, 0.70, 0.86, 0.92, 0.94, 0)
x <- c(100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 115)

ggplot(data.frame(x=x, y=y), aes(x=x, y=y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE)

cor.test(x, y, method="pearson")
```

:::

## Rank-Transformations

- Why is it more robust? What are Spearman correlations?
- Spearman Correlation are Pearson correlation on **"rank-transformed"** data


::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

xrank <- datawizard::ranktransform(x)
xrank
yrank <- datawizard::ranktransform(y)

ggplot(data.frame(x=xrank, y=yrank), aes(x=x, y=y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE)

cor.test(x, y, method="spearman")
```

## Spearman Bayesian Correlations


::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

cor.test(x, y, method="spearman")
```

:::

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true

cor.test(xrank, yrank, method="pearson")
```

:::

1. Rank-transform variables
2. Compute Bayesian Pearson correlation

## Exercice {background-color="#FFAB91"}

::: {.nonincremental}

- In the `iris` in-built dataset, report the Spearman correlation between `Petal.Length` and `Petal.Width` for the `setosa` species only
- Desired output^[Note that your exact values might slightly differ due to the *stochastic* (i.e., random) nature of the MCMC algorithm]:

```{r}
#| echo: false

data <- dplyr::filter(iris, Species=="setosa")

rez <- BayesFactor::correlationBF(data$Petal.Length, data$Petal.Width)
bayestestR::describe_posterior(rez)
```
