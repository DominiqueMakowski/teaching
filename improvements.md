# Bayesian

- Make R refresher either a full 2 hours / an online video pre-course
- Part on OLS vs. MLE very confusing. Introduce OLS directly using formulas, make example for correlation / regression. Mention sigma, and only after present MLE idea and what this sigma represents.
- Assignment: Make TAP 1 in-person (during week 6) + final TAP (make it report) at the end (**AFTER** the last lecture, not week 9)
- https://github.com/benjamin-rosenbaum/bayesian-intro
- Lecture 8 is too much for one (need to introduce data grids, posterior predictive checks, intercept-only models etc)
- Lecture 8/9: change PP checks to use modelbased's estimate_predictions and estimate_relation() 
- ROPEs don't like Defaults
