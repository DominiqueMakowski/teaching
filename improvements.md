# GitHub

- Timing MRes workshop: 1h30 for part 1 and 2 (relatively fast paced).

# Physiology

- Timing "Embodied Brain" (UG)
  - 50 min till the the how would you measure interoception break. Good how it was.
- Timing 2025: 2h topics: had to rush through HRV part
  - Remove ANS part
  - OR Focus on ECG + Cardiac phase (skip ANS + HRV)
- Insula: Add Craig's model ("How do you feel - now?")
- On Respiratory Cycles:
  - The respiratory cycle modulates distinct dynamics of affective and perceptual decision-making: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379401636_The_respiratory_cycle_modulates_distinct_dynamics_of_affective_and_perceptual_decision-making
- Pupil dilation and prediction error: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/385429455_Pupil_dilation_offers_a_time-window_on_prediction_error
- Heart rate applications:
  - https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42761-022-00151-4
- Respiration:
  - Difference between belt, Impendence pneumography (electrodes on the chest), Spirometers (air flow), Thermistors (hot air vs cold air)

# Bayesian

## 2026

- Week 1: RefreshR: 2h full (had to rush a bit towards the end)
- Week 2: Distributions until Cauchy (had to rush a lot)
- Week 3: Distributions from Cauchy + Frequentist (rushed, skipped the quantile function and manual computation of the p-value, but ended 10 min before the end)
-
## 2025
- 2025: did everything in 10 weeks, but semester is 11.
- Assignment: Make TAP 1 in-person (during week 6) + final TAP (make it report) at the end (**AFTER** the last lecture, not week 9)
- https://github.com/benjamin-rosenbaum/bayesian-intro
- Lecture 8 is too much for one (need to introduce data grids, posterior predictive checks, intercept-only models etc)
- Lecture 8/9: change PP checks to use modelbased's estimate_predictions and estimate_relation()
- "ROPEs don't like Defaults"
- MCMC: read https://www.jeremykun.com/2015/04/06/markov-chain-monte-carlo-without-all-the-bullshit/
