"13/03/2025","Bayesian","PhD (Psychology)","Great visual explanations used to get the concepts across","smaller room","Exceptional",4,4,4
"13/03/2025","Bayesian","PhD (Neuroscience)","It makes you think cos there a lot of questions during the teaching (a lot of them trick questions but still good). The content is good and covers a broad range of methods and components of Bayes. ","More detail on the computational details of the procedures. Like Gaussian Quadrature, please tell us what that is instead of telling us to just believe you on it. I get that it complicated by I think we can handle a bit more detail. ",NA,4,4,4
"13/03/2025","Bayesian","MRes","the code is very well explained on the slides and they are explained even further in class, it makes it very easy to go over notes and actually remember what was going on  ","a practice paper for the TAP would have made me feel a lot less anxious about the process","Above average",3,4,4
"13/03/2025","Bayesian","MRes","I liked the pace, the teaching style, and the depth of detail. Everything was explained so well. It has definitely been my favourite module this term :)","Nothing!","Above average",4,4,4
"13/03/2025","Bayesian","MRes","Relaxed pace, engaging teaching style, cake = good","Maybe some reading or some way to understand more of the written applications or real-life examples of how Bayes is used. idk if that makes sense but i feel the need to visualise and understand exactly how i would use statistics ","Above average",3,4,3
