"322733","{""Occupation"":""PhD Psychology"",""WhatDidYouLike"":""Really clear and thorough introduction to Bayesian statistics, that even starts off by revising Frequentist statistics and how Bayes links to these. The course is also technical enough, without bogging the lectures down in complex math formulas that scares and confuses people. Really great stuff!"",""WhatWouldYouChange"":""It would've been nice in the Bayes Factor lecture in Weeks 5 + 6 to have gone over in a little more detail the approach to t-tests in which we define our own priors based on previous effect sizes. I know you tend to use defaults, but the students' previous teaching on Bayes from Zoltan's lecture in the Autumn term very much talks about using Bayes factors in this way, so it'd be helpful just to spend maybe an extra slide or two talking about this methods, so it helps link back to previous teaching and understanding.
