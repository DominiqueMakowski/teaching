I really appreciated the fact that it was mostly theoretical, as I am not used to using R and I would have found difficulties in running too many codes. I liked that the codes were embedded in the slides, but the course wasn't too much focused on it. You are a very brilliant professor, that explains the contents very clearly. I enjoyed a lot this course ""}","feedback","survey-text","3","11110121","0.0-3.0","",""
