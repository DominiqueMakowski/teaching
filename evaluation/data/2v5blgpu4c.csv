This is fine if you understand the R coding, but if you begin to fall behind then there is nothing there to help you understand or get back to full understanding. I would love to see more extensive explanations of the R coding further into the module, particularly around how to actually perform the bayesian inference and work through it all ""}","freetext","survey-text","0","137897","0.0-0.0","",""
